# The ISNCSCI Form

A version of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) that has been adapted for REDCap. The module will take values, calculate scores, and allows users to save the report to an associated REDCap instrument in the project. 

# Usage

Simply enable the module in a REDCap project, and you should be able to fill in the form to calculate scores for motor and sensory points for different body parts. If you install our custom REDCap instrument then you should be able to save your data to a chosen record and event, after calculation. See below for more details.

# Custom REDCap Instrument

We've created a REDCap instrument that contains variables for each field in the module. Use this to save your data into a REDCap project. It can be found on our public GitHUB at https://github.com/fom-ds-redcap/isncsci-form/blob/main/IsncsciExam_2023-05-23_1513.zip.
